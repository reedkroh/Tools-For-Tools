 <h2>About Us</h2>
 <p>T4T (Tools for Tools) can be described as a cross between industrial tool rental company United Rentals and
   CraigsList. Our goal is to help consumers in need of tools that they don't want or don't need to buy. Either they
   don't have the money right now to buy it or it's a one-off project.</p>
 <p>If you are in need of a tool, click on the "RENT" link to find one of the options that we offer.</p>
 <p>If you have a tool that you are willing to lend out, click on the "LEND" link and we will be in touch with you
   after you provide some pertinent information.</p>
 <p>Additionally, if you Need Advice for your project or even just navigating our site, click on the "CALL DAVE"
   link. You will be able to contact us to get the help you need. Unfortunately, it's not always Dave. We keep him
   busy.</p>
